                Hi, I am Lev Xue, a published poet and a PHD student writing my dissertation on the social and intellectual history of progressive nursery school teachers who work at a time when psychoanalytic psychiatry was dominant in American Medical Science and Elite Culture (1930s - 1950s). Once upon a time I worked for Meta as a software engineer, and I received my undergraduate education and graduate education at Harvard.

                <p>
                My specialties are in the history of English-American poetry, and the history of 20th century America. I am looking for a couple of students in history, english, social studies, or other humanities field to tutor. I am also a heritage-speaker of mandarin. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I can also work with you on beginning, editing and revising essays. I have expertise working with admissions essays, and creative or history thesis manuscripts. 
                </p>
